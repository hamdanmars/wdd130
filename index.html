    <p>Uganda, known as the "Pearl of Africa," is a vibrant nation with over 56 indigenous tribes, each with unique cultural traditions.
       The Baganda, Banyankole, Basoga, and Bakiga are among the largest ethnic groups.
        Ugandan culture is expressed through energetic dances like the Bwola and Amagunjju,
         traditional instruments like the adungu harp, and colorful attire like the gomesi and kanzu.
         The country is also famous for its hospitality, oral storytelling traditions,
          and delicious cuisine including matooke (steamed bananas) and luwombo (steamed meat or vegetables in banana leaves).</p>
